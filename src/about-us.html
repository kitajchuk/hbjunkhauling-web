    <div class="lock__txt">
      <p>We are a locally owned family business serving the Eugene, Springfield and surrounding areas. We recognized the need of proper waste disposal for unwanted items which led us to starting our own hauling service, HB Junk Hauling!</p>
      <p>Starting the business allowed us to help clean up the local community and remove and haul away items that might be problematic for people to dispose of  themselves. Our business donates and recycles as much as possible and then dumps what we absolutely must. This helps everyone in the community as well as limiting what piles up in our landfills.</p>
      <p>Our work ethic, customer service skills and our enjoyment of working with our local community is key to success! Our priority of serving you in a timely manner,  being efficient in every way and leaving you with a positive and friendly experience is of the utmost importance to us at HB Junk Hauling! We will always strive to leave you with the result you hoped for and a positive lasting impression!</p>
