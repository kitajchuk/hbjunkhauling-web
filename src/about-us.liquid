      <p>
        We are a locally owned family business serving the Eugene, Springfield 
        and surrounding areas. We recognized the need of proper waste disposal
        for unwanted items which led us to starting our own hauling service, HB
        Junk Hauling!
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting the business allowed us to help clean up the local community 
        and remove and haul away items that might be problematic for people to
        dispose of themselves. Our business donates and recycles as much as
        possible and then dumps what we absolutely must. This helps everyone in
        the community as well as limiting what piles up in our landfills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work ethic, customer service skills and our enjoyment of working 
        with our local community is key to success! Our priority of serving you
        in a timely manner, being efficient in every way and leaving you with a
        positive and friendly experience is of the utmost importance to us at HB
        Junk Hauling! We will always strive to leave you with the result you
        hoped for and a positive lasting impression!
